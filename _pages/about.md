<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

Hello! I am a Graduate Assistant and PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Nevada, Las Vegas](https://unlv.edu), where I work in the Software Evolution (EVOL) Lab led by [Professor John Businge](https://johnxu21.github.io).

Previously, I served as an Assistant Lecturer at [Gulu University](https://gu.ac.ug) and as a Research Fellow with the [AirQo Project](https://airqo.net), collaborating with [Prof. Engineer Bainomugisha](https://ibaino.net/). I hold an MSc in Computer Science from [Makerere University](https://mak.ac.ug), Uganda, where I was mentored by [Dr. Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende](https://sites.google.com/view/jnabende/home) and [Prof. Michel R.V. Chaudron](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/michel-rv-chaudron).

### Research Interests

My research centers on empirical software engineering, including:
- Clone detection 
- Patch integration
- Program Comprehension
- Mining software repositories
- Software re-engineering
- AI4SE & SE4AI
- Air quality monitoring - Software design

For a complete list of my publications, please visit my profiles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZpCrmOQAAAAJ&hl=en) or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0133-8164). Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaboration or learning more about my work!
